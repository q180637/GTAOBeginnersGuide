                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Air Freight Cargo is an active business offered to the player by Nervous Ron upon purchasing a Hangar from the Maze Bank Foreclosures website. There are 2 locations where the player can purchase a Hangar which are Los Santos International Airport (LSIA) and Fort Zancudo with the cheapest hangar being LSIA Hangar A17 at GTA$1,200,000 going all the way up to GTA$3,350,000 for Fort Zancudo Hangar A2. Purchasing a Hangar at Fort Zancudo will also grant the player low level access to the base which means they can fly over and drive through it without attaining a wanted level although certain actions such as stealing vehicles will still punsish the player. Hangars contain a laptop computer which can be accessed by Registering as a SecuroServ CEO, VIP or MC President. SecuroServ CEO or VIP status can be accessed from the interaction menu once the player has met the specific requirements for each. Becoming a CEO requires the player to own an Executive Office from the Dynasty8 Executive website while the player can become a VIP by simply having GTA$50,000 in their Maze Bank Account. An MC President meanwhile would need the player to own a Motorcycle Club Clubhouse. Once the player accesses the laptop found inside the Hangar office they can then start sourcing Cargo which can later be sold.

                    Sourcing Cargo
                </h1>
                <h2>
                   Accessing the Free Trade Shipping Co website from the laptop computer inside the Hangar allows the player to see their current stock, source more (up to a maximum of 50 crates) or sell what they have. In the Air Freight Cargo business there are 8 types of Cargo which can be sourced: Narcotics, Chemicals, Medical Supplies, Animal Materials, Art & Antiques, Jewelry & Gemstones, Tobacco & Alchohol and Counterfeit Goods. Similar to the Special Cargo business there is no specific difference between these Cargo types in terms of the source missions aside from the asset model used when viewing collected crates inside the Hangar. Choosing to source one of these will select one of 14 different missions that all require the player to use some form of air vehicle to locate and return cCargo to the Hangar. All of these missions have some unique mechanic used to locate the selected Cargo crate such as shooting down 3 Cargo Planes in a V-65 Molotok or destroying a number of signal jammers with an FH-1 Hunter. It is important to note that whilst the mission will provide the player with a vehicle they are not required to use it and can instead choose to use one of the own. Furthermore, returning a particular type of Cargo to the Hangar will start a 3 minute cooldown in which the player cannot source it again although they can acquire any of the other types. Finally, more Cargo can be retrieved if missions are completed in multiplayer as similar to the MC business resupply missions the number of Organisation Associates, VIP Bodygards or Motorcycle Club Members will dictate the number of crates spawned by the mission.
                   <br><br>
                   Sourcing Air Freight Cargo also has another benefit to the player aside from being able to sell it as at set numbers of source missions completed the player will unlock the trade price (discounted cost) for the air vehicles on the Elit√°s Travel and Warstock Cache & Carry websites that were added in the Smuggler's Run update which brought the Hangar and its business. These trade prices are awarded as follows:

                <h1>
                    Selling Cargo
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    As with all businesses the player can choose to sell their cargo at whatever stock level they have in the Hangar. There are 8 sell missions available for the Air Freight Cargo business which are all differentiated by the vehicle that the player is issued for the delivery with the options being: Havok, Bombushka, Skylift, Cargobob, Hunter, Mogul, Alpha-Z1 and Seabreeze. There are no rules to how the sell mission is chosen as they are entirely random with each mission all giving the player 20 minutes to complete the sale. Additionally, the value of the sale will differ based on what cargo is being sold. This is because there are bonuses available for selling specific amounts of each cargo type. With regards to Narcotics, Chemicals and Medical Supplies there is a bonus of 35% for every 25 crates of the same type sold in delivery up to a maximum of a 70% increase if selling a full 50 crates of one type. Animal Materials, Art & Antiques and Jewelry & Gemstones will get a 12% bonus for every 10 crates of the same type and finally Counterfeit Goods and Tobacco & Alcohol both receieve a 5% bonus for every 5 matching crates. Furthermore, Nervous Ron takes a 5% cut of all money earned in a sale. As a result, following the Los Santos Drug Wars update which increased the value of a single crate from GTA$10,000 to GTA$30,000, the most the player can profit from an Air Freight Cargo sale is GTA$2,550,000 assuming that the delivery was 50 crates of Medical Supplies, Chemicals or Narcotics and no external boosters are active such as Social Club events or the High Demand Bonus.
