                    General Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Within Grand Theft Auto Online a player will mostly progress through earning the in game currency
                    known as GTA$. This can be achieved through making use of a variety of businesses which can be
                    categorised in two ways. Firstly is whether a business is active or passive. An active business
                    refers to one where the player has to actively partake in a gameplay loop of collecting and then
                    selling products in order to profit from it. Meanwhile passive businesses will transform supplies
                    into product over a period of time and will usually feature a series of upgrades to improve their
                    efficiency. Furthermore, most businesses require the player to be registered as either a Securoserv
                    CEO or an MC President in order for them to be able to make profits. Some businesses are exclusive
                    to one or the other; however, most of the newer businesses added in recent updates can be done as
                    either.
                    <br><br>
                    Please note that all earnings calculations provided across this guide do not factor in Social Club
                    bonuses or the High Demand Bonus from selling in a public lobby.

                <h1>
                    CEO Businesses
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    In order to utilise the 2 businesses limited to registering as a SecuroServ CEO the player must
                    first purchase an executive office from the Dynasty 8 Executive website accessible from their phone
                    or any laptop. With ownership of one of these offices which range in price from GTA$1,000,000 to
                    GTA$4,000,000 the player can then register as a CEO from the Securoserv section of their interaction
                    menu. As a CEO the player can then access the terminal located in their executive office and begin
                    trading illicit goods or exporting vehicles on the SecuroServ network.

                <h2>
                    Similar to registering as a CEO, to become a Motorcycle Club President the player must first
                    purchase a property. In this case it is the Biker Clubhouse which have prices starting at
                    GTA$200,000 and ending at GTA$495,000. Upon purchase the player can then register as an MC President
                    under the Motorcycle Club section of the interaction menu. As an MC President they can then use the
                    laptop in their clubhouse to access the secure Open Road website and begin buying the various
                    businesses of which there are 5 that can be managed.

                <h2>
                    Grand Theft Auto Online also features a number of businesses that can be run as either a SecuroServ
                    CEO or an MC President. Additionally, these businesses can also be run as a SecuroServ VIP which
                    only requires the player to have GTA$50,000 in their account but can only be used for 4 hours at a
                    time. Such businesses include but are not limited to the Gunrunning Bunker, the Nightclub and the
                    Acid Lab added in the latest update Los Santos Drug Wars.
