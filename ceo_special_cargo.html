                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    SecuroServ Special Cargo is one of the first businesses added to Grand Theft Auto Online and can only be run as a SecuroServ CEO. Registering as a CEO requires an executive office to be bought from Dynasty8 Executive which will include a terminal that can access the SecuroServ Special Cargo Network. From here the player can purchase a Cargo Warehouse that will allow them to begin sourcing and selling cargo. 
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    Sourcing Cargo
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Sourcing cargo requires the player to own a Cargo Warehouse which can be purchased from the Executive Office computer and come in 3 sizes: Small, Medium and Large. Small warehouses can hold up to 16 cargo crates, medium warehouses can store 42 cargo crates and a large warehouse has a capacity of 111 crates. After purchasing a cargo warehouse the player can return to their Executive Office Computer where they will have the option to select one of their owned warehouses and purchase cargo for it. Every size of warehouse has the same options for beginning a source mission: 1 crate, 2 crates or 2 crates. A 1 crate source mission will cost GTA$2,000; 2 crates cost GTA$8,000 and 3 crates cost $18,0000. The purchase special cargo screen will also detail what type of cargo is available for purchase for the selected warehouse at that time. There are 11 types of cargo product that can be sourced: Animal Materials; Art & Antiques; Buillon; Counterfeit Goods; Electronic Goods; Gemstones; Jewelry; Medical Supplies; Narcotics; Tobacco & Alcohol and finally Weapons & Ammo. Every cargo type has the same value per crate with the only difference being the in game model that can be seen by entering the warehouse. After purchasing any amount of crates the player will be given a mission where they are tasked with going out into Los Santos and Blaine County to track down and return the cargo to their warehouse. 
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside the types of cargo listed above the player will occasionally be able to purchase a Special item on the SecuroServ terminal in their executive office. When this option is available the player will receive a call from their Executive Assistant to tell them that the item is available and that they should go check out the SecuroServ Special Cargo network the next time they are at the Executive Office. These Special Items will cost a lot more but will also always sell for 5x their value. Each item has a unique price unlike the standard Special Cargo crates starting at GTA$19,000 and going up to GTA$30,000. There are 6 Special items that could be offered: Film Reel; Rare Hide; Golden Minigun; Ornamental Egg; Large Diamond and a Rare Pocket Watch.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally following The Criminal Enterprises update released in July 2022, each Special Cargo Warehouse will feature a Warehouse Technician. Speaking to this NPC will give the player the option to ask the Technician to source cargo for GTA$7,500. Choosing this option will have the Technician walk out of the warehouse and then after 1 in game day - 48 minutes in real world time - they will return with 1 to 3 cargo crates. This feature allows the player to partake in other activities across GTA Online whilst still filling their cargo warehouse.

                <h2>
                    After collecting any amount of any type of cargo the player can then enter their cargo warehouse and visit a laptop near the entrance that connects to the Ad-Hawk webstie in order to choose a sale. There will normally be three options available although this will depend on the number of crates in the warehouse and will dictate the amount of the total cargo sold in that particular delivery. Once the player has chosen a number of crates to sell the game will randomly choose a delivery method to be used in the sale. There are three delivery missions that could be chosen: Brickades, Titan and Tug Boat.
