                        SecuroServ Special Cargo is one of the first businesses added to Grand Theft Auto Online and can only be run as a SecuroServ CEO. Registering as a CEO requires an executive office to be bought from Dynasty8 Executive which will include a terminal that can access the SecuroServ Special Cargo Network. From here the player can purchase a Cargo Warehouse that will allow them to begin sourcing and selling cargo.

                        Sourcing Cargo
                    </h1>
                    <h2>
                        Sourcing cargo requires the player to own a Cargo Warehouse which can be purchased from the Executive Office computer and come in 3 sizes: Small, Medium and Large. Small warehouses can hold up to 16 cargo crates, medium warehouses can store 42 cargo crates and a large warehouse has a capacity of 111 crates. After purchasing a cargo warehouse the player can return to their Executive Office Computer where they will have the option to select one of their owned warehouses and purchase cargo for it. Every size of warehouse has the same options for beginning a source mission: 1 crate, 2 crates or 2 crates. A 1 crate source mission will cost GTA$2,000; 2 crates cost GTA$8,000 and 3 crates cost $18,0000. The purchase special cargo screen will also detail what type of cargo is available for purchase for the selected warehouse at that time. There are 11 types of cargo product that can be sourced: Animal Materials; Art & Antiques; Buillon; Counterfeit Goods; Electronic Goods; Gemstones; Jewelry; Medical Supplies; Narcotics; Tobacco & Alcohol and finally Weapons & Ammo. Every cargo type has the same value per crate with the only difference being the in game model that can be seen by entering the warehouse. After purchasing any amount of crates the player will be given a mission where they are tasked with going out into Los Santos and Blaine County to track down and return the cargo to their warehouse. 
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally following The Criminal Enterprises update released in July 2022, each Special Cargo Warehouse will feature a Warehouse Technician. Speaking to this NPC will give the player the option to ask the Technician to source cargo for GTA$7,500. Choosing this option will have the Technician walk out of the warehouse and then after 1 in game day - 48 minutes in real world time - they will return with 1 to 3 cargo crates. This features the player to partake in other activities across GTA online whilst still filling their cargo warehouse.
