                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Document Forgery Offices are one of the five passive businesses available for purchase as an MC President. To register as an MC President the player needs to purchase one of the 12 clubhouses available around the map. This will then allow them to become an MC President in the interaction menu and access the Open Road website from the laptop in their office. On the Open Road website the player can choose to purchase a Document Forgery Office in one of 4 locations: Grapeseed, Paleto Bay, Elysian Island or Textile City which range in price from GTA$650,000 to GTA$1,235,000. As the Document Forgery Office is a passive business it must be frequently restocked with supplies that can then be turned into a sellable product. The rate at which supplies are consumed and the value of the product produced can be improved through purchasing upgrades from the laptop inside the Document Forgery Office.
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    Sourcing Supplies
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Like all of the MC businesses there are two ways that the player can source supplies for the Document Forgery Office: stealing supplies or buying them. Stealing supplies can be started from the Open Road website on the laptop inside the Document Forgery Office and then navigating to the Resupply page and choosing Steal Supplies. This will start a short mission in Free Mode that tasks the player with locating, collecting and returning "Supplies" back to the Document Forgery Office. Upon starting one of these missions the game will choose one of 10 missions to give the player some of which are as simple as collecting a vehicle or bag with others having some minor mechanics involved. The majority of these missions are shared with the other 4 MC businesses with the exception of one: Meeting a contact for identities to forge with. This unique mission has the player attend an identity deal which will then get attacked before the player has to escape with the supplies. Stealing supplies generates 1 unit of supplies per member of the Motorcycle Club with each player only being able to collect 1 unit before having to return them to the business.
                    <br><br>
                    Alternatively, the player could choose to buy supplies on the same Open Road resupply page. This will cost the player between GTA$15,000 and GTA$75,000 depending on how many units of supplies are purchased. While this option allows the player to partake in Grand Theft Auto Online's other profiteering activites by skipping a potentially time consuming mission it will cut into their profits. Should the player choose to buy supplies as their resupply option the player will receive a notification informing them that the supplies are on the way to the business and will arrive shortly. Roughly 10 minutes later the business' supplies bar will be completely filled up from whatever level it was previously at.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon collecting any amount of supplies the business will begin to produce product over time. Without any business upgrades the Document Forgery Office will require the player to have the business producing product for 300 minutes or 5 hours in order to have a full bar of product. This time can be reduced to merely three hours by purchasing the Staff and Equipment upgrades from the Open Road laptop inside the Document Forgery Office which will cost a total of GTA$745,000.
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    Selling Product
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    After any amount of product has been generated the player can visit the Open Road website from the laptop inside their Document Forgery Office and choose to sell their product to either a local buyer in the same county as the business or a remote buyer further afield. Like all other MC businesses there are 7 possible sell missions which the player could be given and are differentiated by the delivery vehicle the player has to use. Some of the missions also have certain challenges that the player has to handle during the sale as well such as flying a Dodo seaplane at low level to five aerial drop locations whereas others are as simple as delivering a Western Bagger to a location. 
                    <br><br>
                    The highest amount of GTA$ a player can earn from a single sale in this business is GTA$151,000 on a remote sale with both the Staff and Equipment upgrades being purchased. If the player chooses to only purchase supplies when the business has none remaining to fill up their Document Forgery Office it will cost them GTA$150,000 making this the least profitable MC business with a maximum full sale profit of GTA$1,000. Please note that these values are calculated with the assumption that no supplies are remaining from previous production cycles and does not account for the player being able to make money with other methods while the business is producing.
