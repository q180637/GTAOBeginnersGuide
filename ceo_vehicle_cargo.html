                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    An expansion to the SecuroServ CEO system added with Further Adventures in Finance and Felony that brought SecuroServ Special Cargo, the Import/Export update added SecuroServ Vehicle Cargo which allows the player to buy a Vehicle Warehouse from which they can source and sell cars. As with SecuroServ Special Cargo this business is only operable as a SecuroServ CEO and requires the Vehicle Warehouse to be purchased from the SecuroServ terminal in the Executive Office.

                <h1>
                    Sourcing Vehicle Cargo
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Owning a Vehicle Warehouse - of which there are 9 that have prices ranging from GTA$1,500,000 to GTA$2,850,000 - allows a player to begin a Source Vehicle mission from the Executive Terminal in their office. Opting to start one of these missions will give the player one of 15 different tasks which have various systems in place from simply retrieving a parked vehicle to having to stop a car racing around a closed track or being chased by the police. Regardless of the mission the player is given once they reach the vehicle all they need to do is drive the car to the Vehicle Warehouse. There are however two missions which are exceptions to this: Stationary Car Bomb and Heist Crew. In Stationary Car Bomb the player will receive a communication from their Executive Assistant informing them that the car has a bomb fitted to it which will detonate if the vehicle does not maintain a certain speed. Meanwhile, in Heist Crew the player will have to airlift the vehicle from a heavily defended offshore rig using a Cargobob helicopter. In every Source Vehicle mission the player is also required to drive carefully as they will be charged a repair fee for any damages caused upon returning it to the Vehhicle Warehouse. Furthermore, there are 3 types of Vehicle which can be sourced: Standard Range, Mid Range and Top Range. These vehicle types will dictate not only the difficulty of the source mission but also how much the vehicle will sell for.

                <h1>
                    Selling Vehicle Cargo
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    The sale of Vehicle Cargo is initiated from within the Vehicle Warehouse. On the right hand side of the entrance to the warehouse there is a small office which contains a laptop connected to the Ad-Hawk Autos website. From this laptop the player can choose to sell between 1 and 4 vehicles from their collection. Each sale will have three choices of buyer which will impact the profit they can make from the vehicle: Private, Showroom and Specialist Dealer. Choosing the Private buyer requires no upfront costs and will result in less AI enemies attack the player but has the lowest payout at a maximum of GTA$40,000 on Top Range vehicles. Alternatively, should the player choose a Showroom buyer the player will have to invest GTA$10,000 in modifications for a maximum payout of GTA$70,000 for a Top Range vehicle. Finally, the Specialist Dealer will require a GTA$20,000 investment for a payout of GTA$100,000. After choosing a buyer and making any required modifications the player will then be given a destination to which they have to drive the Vehicle(s). Players will have to be careful with their driving on this mission as any damage to the vehicle will cause a decrease in its value
