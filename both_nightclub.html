                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Grand Theft Auto Online Nightclubs are businesses that feature both active and passive means of earning money and have 3 main sources of income: the wall safe, Nightclub work and the Underground Warehouse. They are also one of the only businesses that can produce money legally. The wall safe and underground warehouse are both passive sources of income whilst the Nightclub work is an active money making method that requires the player to complete free roam missions. In order to access this content the player must first purchase a Nightclub from the Maze Bank Foreclosures website for between GTA$1,080,000 and GTA$1,645,000 and register as a SecuroServ VIP, CEO or MC President. SecuroServ VIP status is restricted to players that have GTA$50,000 in their Maze Bank account whilst being CEO of an organisation requires an Executive Office from the Dynasty8 Executive website. Similarly, an MC President must own a Clubhouse from the Maze Bank Foreclosures.

                    Legitimate Earnings
                </h1>
                <h2>
                   The primary way of making money with the Nightclub using Legitimate methods is the wall safe which will accumulate a set amount of GTA$ every in game day (48 minutes in the real world) based on the popularity of the Nightclub. When Nightclub popularity is at its highest the Wall Safe will accumulate GTA$50,000 per in game day. Once the Nightclub popularity decreases to 90% the daily income will be GTA$45,000 and will continue to decrease each day the popularity is not increased to a lower limit of GTA$1,500 per day at 5%. Furthermore, the Wall Safe can hold a maximum of GTA$250,000 meaning that provided the popularity is maintained at 90% or higher for 5 in game days in a row the player does not have to empty the safe. Maintaining this high popularity rating can be acheived by use of Nightclub popularity missions which can be started from the Nightclub management terminal in the Nightclub office or by calling Tony Prince or Lazlow Jones and choosing request Popularity mission. Similarly, when the player is not inside the Nightclub they may receive a phone call from English Dave with a special request that can be either accepted or declined. If a player manually requests a Nightclub popularity mission from either the terminal or calling the aforementioned NPCs the game will randomly select one of 14 missions for them to complete in free mode; 10 of which are from Tony Prince and the remaining 4 are from Lazlow Jones. The majority of these missions task the player with perfectly legal activities such as distributing posters and flyers or colelcting a VIP. Others are less legal and will have the player destroy some supplies or eliminate rival operations. When English Dave calls the player they will be given 1 of 4 different missions that have similar mechanics.
