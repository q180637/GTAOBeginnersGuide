                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Grand Theft Auto Online Nightclubs are businesses that feature both active and passive means of earning money and have 3 main sources of income: the wall safe, Nightclub work and the Underground Warehouse. They are also one of the only businesses that can produce money legally. The wall safe and underground warehouse are both passive sources of income whilst the Nightclub work is an active money making method that requires the player to complete free roam missions. In order to access this content the player must first purchase a Nightclub from the Maze Bank Foreclosures website for between GTA$1,080,000 and GTA$1,645,000 and register as a SecuroServ VIP, CEO or MC President. SecuroServ VIP status is restricted to players that have GTA$50,000 in their Maze Bank account whilst being CEO of an organisation requires an Executive Office from the Dynasty8 Executive website. Similarly, an MC President must own a Clubhouse from the Maze Bank Foreclosures.

                <h1>
                    Legitimate Earnings
                </h1>
                <h2>
                   The primary way of making money with the Nightclub using Legitimate methods is the wall safe which will accumulate a set amount of GTA$ every in game day (48 minutes in the real world) based on the popularity of the Nightclub. When Nightclub popularity is at its highest the Wall Safe will accumulate GTA$50,000 per in game day. Once the Nightclub popularity decreases to 90% the daily income will be GTA$45,000 and will continue to decrease each day the popularity is not increased to a lower limit of GTA$1,500 per day at 5%. Furthermore, the Wall Safe can hold a maximum of GTA$250,000 meaning that provided the popularity is maintained at 90% or higher for 5 in game days in a row the player does not have to empty the safe. Maintaining this high popularity rating can be acheived by use of Nightclub popularity missions which can be started from the Nightclub management terminal in the Nightclub office or by calling Tony Prince or Lazlow Jones and choosing request Popularity mission. Similarly, when the player is not inside the Nightclub they may receive a phone call from English Dave with a special request that can be either accepted or declined. If a player manually requests a Nightclub popularity mission from either the terminal or calling the aforementioned NPCs the game will randomly select one of 14 missions for them to complete in free mode; 10 of which are from Tony Prince and the remaining 4 are from Lazlow Jones. The majority of these missions task the player with perfectly legal activities such as distributing posters and flyers or colelcting a VIP. Others are less legal and will have the player destroy some supplies or eliminate rival operations. When English Dave calls the player they will be given 1 of 4 different missions that have similar mechanics. As of the Criminal Enterprises update in 2022 there is also another random mission that the player can occasionally receive. Sometimes upon entering their nightclub the player will receive a text from Marcel the bouncer stating that there is a troublemaker or a drunk VIP. Troublemakers can be ejected from the Nightclub by simply walking up to the blue dot that will appear on the player's map and then pressing the interaction key (defaults to D-Pad right on controllers and E on a keyboard). Meanwhile, if a drunk VIP is present the player will once more have to walk up to them and press the interaction key which will then place them in a free roam mission where they have to drive the NPC in a Nightclub limo to either a random house in North Vinewood or a random hospital anywhere across Los Santos and Blaine County.
                   <br><br>
                   Alternatively, the player can visit the Nightclub management terminal inside the Nightclub office and then navigate to the Resident DJ page where they can then choose a new choose to hire a new DJ or switch to any that have been previously hired. Hiring a new DJ will cost the player GTA$100,000 and place them into a specific mission unique to the DJ they have chosen and then completely fill the Nightclub popularity. Meanwhile, switching to a previously hired DJ will cost GTA$10,000 and simply trigger a short cutscene providing a 10% popularity increase. Switching DJs can be done repeatedly in quick succession to rapidly fill up Nightclub popularity.

                <h1>
                    Nightclub Warehouse
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    The illegitimate business at the Nightclub is the undergound warehouse. This warehouse - once setup - can be run completley passively until the player wishes to sell their goods. To accrue goods in the Nightclub warehouse the player must first own at least one of the following: <a href="ceo_special_cargo.html">CEO Special Cargo</a>; <a href="both_hangar.html">Air Freight Cargo</a>; <a href="both_bunker.html">Gunrunning Bunker</a>; <a href="mc_coke.html">MC Cocaine Lockup</a>; <a href="mc_meth.html">MC Methamphetamine Lab</a>; <a href="mc_cash_factory.html">MC Counterfeit Cash Factory</a>; <a href="mc_weed_farm.html">MC Weed Farm</a> or <a href="mc_doc_forgery.html">MC Document Forgery</a>. Owning any one of these businesses will allow the player to go to the warehouse management page on the Nightclub terminal and assign one of their technicians, of which five can be hired for a total of GTA$878,000, to acquiring the particular goods. By default the Nightclub warehouse will only have one floor meaning there is very little capacity for each goods type to be stored. A further 4 warehouse floors can be added upon purchasing the Nightclub or rennovating it on Maze Bank Foreclosures up to a maximum of 5 floors costing a total of GTA$1,702,550. When fully upgraded including the Nightclub's equipment upgrade found from the Nightclub management terminal for GTA$1,425,000, all five technicians and every business the underground warehouse can store up to GTA$1,931,500 in goods. These goods can be sold by choosing one of the Sell Stock options on the warehouse management page of which there are 11: 7 are selling a specific goods type, 3 are special bundles with the final being to sell everything. The special bundles are randomised requiring specific amounts of various goods types and give a 10% bonus over just selling the same amount individually. Choosing any of these sale options will place all the cargo into a single vehicle and then choose 1 of 10 sell missions which may have complications such as a Police ambush or having to locate the destination. If the player is selling between 1 and 89 crates they will use the default Speedo Custom in this mission however larger sales will require the player to own the Mule Custom for up to 179 crates and the Pounder Custom for between 180 and 360 crates. These two vehicles can be purchased from the Warstock Cache and Carry website for GTA$72,000 - GTA$95,760 and GTA$241,000 - GTA$320,530 respectively. The lower costs listed for each vehicle here are the trade prices which can be unlocked by completing Nightclub cargo sales.
