                    Overview
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    The Gunrunning Bunker is a passive business purchasable on Maze Bank Foreclosures for between GTA$1,165,000 and GTA$4,070,000 that does not have any organisational requirement meaning it can be run as a SecuroServ CEO, SecuroServ VIP or MC President. Registering as a SecuroServ CEO needs the player to own an Executive Office from the Dynasty8 Executive website while a SecuroServ VIP only requires the player to have GTA$50,000 in their Maze Bank Account. To register as an MC President the player would need to own a Motorcycle Clubhouse which can be purchased on Maze Bank Foreclosures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As with all passive businesses the Gunrunning Bunker will need to be consistently stocked with supplies. Where the bunker differs however is what can be achieved with those supplies. From the computer found inside the Gunrunning Bunker the player can choose to assign their workers to either Manufacturing, Research or Both. Choosing Manufacturing will mean that supplies are only consumed to make sellable stock similarly choosing Research means supplies are only used in <a href=#research>Weapons Research</a>. On the other hand should the player choose to assign their workers to both the supplies will be used to simultaneously create sellable stock and Weapons Research

                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Again, just like every other passive business there are two ways to acquire supplies for the Gunrunning Bunker. Firstly, the player can choose to steal supplies or buy them. Stealing supplies is free and gives the player a 30 minute mission to locate and return the supplies to their Bunker which can grant up to 2/5ths of their Bunker's supplies bar although they will normally only give 1/5th of the bar. As a result it can oftentimes take up to five missions to completely fill the Bunker's supplies; many of which can be very lengthy and time consuming due to the distance the player has to travel. Furthermore, whilst most Bunker resupply missions do not have a fail state for death and thus the player can die as many times as they like there are some occasions where a death could compromise the success of the mission. For example, on the railgun mission if the player carrying the railgun dies the supplies are destroyed and the mission is failed. Alternatively, the player can buy the supplies for up to GTA$75,000 depending on how many supplies are needed to fill the bar. This will save the player time but will cut into the overall profits.
                    <br><br>
                    Regardless of how the player chooses to source supplies for their Bunker it will take a very long time to produce a full amount of stock. By default and without upgrades the Bunker will need to be set to only Manufacturing for a total of 16 hours and 40 minutes. This time can be decreased to 11 hours and 40 minutes by purchasing the Equipment and Staff upgrade from the laptop computer that is used to control the Bunker for a total of GTA$1,753,500 which will also improve the value of Bunker stock.

                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Once the Bunker has produced any amount of stock the player can go to the laptop computer in their Bunker to connect to the Disruption Logistics website and start a sale mission. There are two options for selling which like the MC Businesses are local and remote. A remote sale will add 50% value to the stock in the delivery although depending on the Bunker location it can result in a very long drive to the drop point. There are a total of 6 possible sell missions that the player can receive when selling Bunker stock: Phantom Wedge, Insurgent Pick-Up Customs ambushed by Merryweather, Insurgent Pick Up Customs, Dune FAV, Marshall and Insurgent. Each mission uses a unique delivery vehicle and has its own challenges for the player to overcome. For example, Phantom Wedge gives the player two containers connected to Phantom Wedge trucks which they must deliver to the sale location without a wanted level while the Merryweather ambush has the player driving Insurgent Pick-Up Customs to several locations around the map and when all vehicles have reached that location they must hold off against increasingly difficult waves of Merryweather mercenaries. By completing a full sale of Bunker stock with both the Staff and Equipment upgrades purchased to a remote location the player can earn up to GTA$1,050,000. If the player only resupplies the Bunker through buying supplies when it has run out they will have to spend GTA375,000 which will mean the sale will have a total profit of GTA$675,000 making the Gunrunning Bunker one of the most profitable businesses for a single sale albeit very tedious to prepare for.

                </h1>
                <h2>
                    The other use of the Gunrunning Bunker property is to perform weapons research. This can be done by assigning staff to Research or Both and will use Bunker supplies to fill the Research bar. When the research bar is completed the player can return to their Disruption Logistics computer and collect a reward randomly selected from a list of 51 options. These options include new liveries and modifications for weaponised vehicles and upgrades for Mark II weaponry. Whilst Research can be allowed to complete passively this will take a long time to get through every Research item and given that each Research task is completely randomised it can be incredibly time consuming to get an unlock the player desires. The wait times on research can be skipped for a fee between GA$45,000 and GTA$225,000 depending on how full the Research bar already is by choosing the Fast Track Research option. Skipping research in this way will cost in excess of GTA$10,000,000 to complete all unlocks but will allow the player to quickly acquire any of the items they want and is therefore widely regarded as the best way of completing research especially when other businesses can be used to quickly make the money back.
